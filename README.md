Developing gradient boosting for relational data




**To run classification:**

A. IMDB dataset:

cmd: python main.py -target [female_gender] -samplingratetrain [25]

-samplingratetrain : percentage of training data randomly sampled for learning.

1. Copy a classification example from test domains both train and test (ex: Toy Cancer) to same directory as .py files or you can write your own.

2. Run command: *python main.py -target <list of target(s)>*

3. For the ToyCancer: python main.py -target [cancer]


**Still in development, pending -> further testing, commenting, cleaning up code and adding more functionality such as MLN learning, soft margin etc.**
